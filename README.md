# csv_sorter

##  A script that takes in a CSV file as input and outputs a new CSV file that is sorted by the values in the second column, in descending order. The script should also be able to handle and gracefully handle any errors that may occur, such as a missing or improperly formatted CSV file. Additionally, the script should include appropriate comments to explain the logic and any key functions or methods used.
